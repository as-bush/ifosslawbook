## Some useful commands to generata Markdown:

**Requires ASCIIDOC**

To generate an intermediary docbook document for all .txt (asciidoc) documents in the directory.

    asciidoc -b docbook *.txt

**Requires Pandoc** (any version).


Assuming you have all the docbook documents in the same place (directory)

    find *.xml -exec pandoc -Ss -f docbook -t markdown_strict+footnotes {} -o {}.xml \;

That creates a number of Markdown documents for all docbook documents in the directory

To generate a single HTML file from the Markdown documents, you need to change the internal footnotes references (as you cannot have two identical footnote reference in the same file) I use this simple substitution script, to be add to a subdirectory, which adds a random number to the footnote references across all files and writes them in the subdirectory:

    #/bin/bash!

    for f in ../*.xml.md

    do

     sed "s/\(\[\^\)\([0-9]\|[0-9][0-9]\|[0-9][0-9][0-9]\)\(\]\)/\1_$RANDOM\_\2\3/g" $f > $(basename $f)

     echo "done with $(basename $f)"

    done

**NOTE**: check that the script went well and copy the resulting documents to the main directory.


Some documents have internal references. There is only a handful of them. You can count how many with:

    grep -c "<<sec" *.txt

So instead of scripting it, you will be content with changing them by hand. You only need to seek for something like

    [section\_title](#sec_finland_moral_rights)

and to do two things:

a) Change the referenced text (the text between square brackets) so to have it look like: 
`  [Moral Rights](#sec_finland_moral_rights) and`
b) Ad the exact part between round brackets next to the relevant section title (where the reference points to) so it looks like:  
`#### Moral Rights {#sec_finland_moral_rights}`


Now you are ready to produce a full HTML or PDF with

    pandoc -Ss -f markdown_strict+footnotes+auto_identifiers+implicit_header_references+header_attributes -o file.html file.pdf *.xml.md

Thank you
